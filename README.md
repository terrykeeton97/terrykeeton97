I have a passion for programming in the languages C# & C++. I also have a keen interest in low-level programming and reverse engineering as they challenge me and I enjoy learning.

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. For markdown files, I make commits much more often. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.
