### :woman_technologist: About Me :
I'm a Roofer by trade who lives in the United Kingdom. I'm learning how to code. I have a passion for programming and a keen interest in low-level programming and reverse engineering as they challenge me and I really enjoy learning.

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. For markdown files, I make commits much more often. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.

---
- :telescope: Iâ€™m currently learning C#, SQL, C++ and ASM x86 with C# being my most confident language.

- :seedling: I like to build, code and play video games.

- :zap: My goal is to have a full career in the Software Development with wide knowledge of back-end and low-level programming.
